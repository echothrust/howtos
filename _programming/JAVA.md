# Maven for noobs
* Building a project `mvn clean package`
* Building without javadoc `-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true`
* Building without `-Dmaven.test.skip=true`
* Jar files are usually under `./target` folder of the project (prefer the generated `*jar-with-dependencies.jar`)
* For projects with submodules look for `target/` folder under each of them
